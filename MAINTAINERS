See CONTRIBUTING.md for details of gem5's contribution process.

This file contains the keywords used in commit messages. Each keyword has one
or more maintainers. At least one (not all) of these maintainers must review
the patch before it can be pushed. These people will automatically be emailed
when you upload the patch to Gerrit (https://gem5-review.googlesource.com).
These keywords mostly follow the directory structure.

Individuals on the project management committee are maintainers for all of the
gem5 components (i.e., they can review any patch as the maintainer). These
individuals are required to review any patches to components without explicit
maintainers.

PMC Members (general maintainers):
Ruben Titos <rtitos@um.es>
Raul Sanchez <raul@um.es>
